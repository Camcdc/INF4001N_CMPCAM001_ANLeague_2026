IMPORTANT RULES:
- Generate 25-35 events spread throughout the FULL 90 minutes (1-90)
- Event types: "goal", "yellow_card", "red_card", "substitution", "commentary"
- MUST include at least 2-4 goals to make it exciting
- Include LOTS of "commentary" events for regular match action (shots, saves, fouls, corners, etc.)
- Commentary events should describe: near misses, great saves, tactical plays, crowd reactions, key moments
- Include events every 3-5 minutes to provide full match coverage
- Events must be in chronological order by minute
- Team names must exactly match: "${team1Name}" or "${team2Name}"
- Make sure final score matches the number of goal events
- Be creative and detailed with descriptions - make it feel like live TV commentary
- Include match phases: early action, mid-game momentum, late drama

Return ONLY the JSON, no other text.`;

      : "No player data available"
  }

CRITICAL: Generate a COMPLETELY RANDOM and UNPREDICTABLE match result. Each simulation must be unique!

IMPORTANT: For ALL goal events, you MUST include the exact player name from the roster who scored.

Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  "events": [
    {
      "minute": 1,
      "type": "commentary",
      "team": "${team1Name}",
      "player": "",
      "description": "The match kicks off! ${team1Name} gets us underway!"
    },
    {
      "minute": 15,
      "type": "goal",
      "team": "${team1Name}",
      "player": "Player Name From Roster",
      "description": "GOAL! Player Name From Roster scores for ${team1Name}! Brilliant finish!"
    }
  ],
  "finalScore": {
    "${team1Name}": 0,
    "${team2Name}": 0
  }
}

MANDATORY RULES:
- For EVERY goal event, the "player" field must contain an EXACT player name from the provided roster
- Use ONLY the player names I provided in the team rosters above
- DO NOT make up player names - use only the real names from the lists
- Total goals can be anywhere from 0-7 goals combined (make it realistic but varied)
- Either team can win, lose, or draw - BE COMPLETELY UNPREDICTABLE
- Score possibilities: 0-0, 1-0, 2-1, 3-2, 1-3, 0-2, 4-1, etc. - ANY realistic combination
- Generate 20-35 events spread throughout the FULL 90 minutes (1-90)
- Event types: "goal", "yellow_card", "red_card", "substitution", "commentary"
- Include LOTS of "commentary" events for regular match action
- Events must be in chronological order by minute
- Team names must exactly match: "${team1Name}" or "${team2Name}"
- Make sure final score matches the number of goal events
- BE CREATIVE - create upsets, comebacks, dominant performances, close games, high-scoring games, defensive battles

IMPORTANT: Every simulation should feel different and unpredictable!

Return ONLY the JSON, no other text.`;
